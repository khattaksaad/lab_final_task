**Tools Used** 
- MIT Information Extraction Lib that is based on dlib - a high-performance machine-learning library[1]. MITIE makes use of several state-of-the-art techniques including the use of distributional word embeddings[2] and Structural Support Vector Machines[3]. MITIE offers several pre-trained models providing varying levels of support for English trained using a variety of linguistic resources (e.g., CoNLL 2003, ACE, Wikipedia, Freebase, and Gigaword).

- [A Multi-task Approach for Named Entity Recognition on Social Media Data](http://noisy-text.github.io/2017/pdf/WNUT19.pdf) [4]. The system uses a Multi-task Neural Network as a feature extractor.
